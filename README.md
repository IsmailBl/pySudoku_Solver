# Python Sudoku Solver

## Introduction

This Python project is a Sudoku solver designed to tackle various Sudoku grids using Backtracking algorithms. Additionally, it aims to incorporate Computer Vision Algorithms to transform an image of a Sudoku grid into a matrix that can be solved later using the backtracking algorithm.

## Backtracking Algorithm

The core solving mechanism of this project utilizes the Backtracking algorithm, a specialized approach for solving Sudoku matrices through brute force. This algorithm systematically explores possible solutions, backtracking when it encounters an invalid configuration until a valid solution is found.

## Features

- **Sudoku Solver:** Utilizes the Backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku grids of varying complexities.
  
- **Computer Vision Integration (Future):** Plans to integrate Computer Vision Algorithms to interpret an image of a Sudoku grid, converting it into a matrix for subsequent solution using the backtracking algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sudoku solver, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver.git
