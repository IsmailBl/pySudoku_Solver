#Python Sudoku SolveR
##Introduction
This project is made with love to solve differnt Sudoku grids using Backtracking algorithms. 
It will also envolve at some point the use of Computer Vision Algorithms to convert an actual image of a sudoku grid to a matrix to be solved later by the backtracking algorithm.
##Back  tracking Algorithm
The backtracking algortihm is specialized in solving sudoku matrixes using brute forcing
